# Problem 1
```{r homicide data}
## read data
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"
homicide <- read_csv(data_url)
```

The raw data contains `r nrow(homicide)` obervations of `r ncol(homicide)` variables, containing `r colnames(homicide)`.

```{r}
## add city_state variable
homicide_tidy <- homicide|>
  mutate(
    city_state = paste(city,state,sep = ",")
  )

```
